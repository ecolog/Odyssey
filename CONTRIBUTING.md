## Thank you for considering contributing to our project!

This project has a lot of room for improvement and a lot of features to be added and with your help we can 
implement more of our ideas.

## What we expect from a contributor?

The project is mainly written on Flask and Svelte, so knowledge in at least one of those is the first requirement. 
You must be fluent with Git and Github, as well as knowing the basics of Scrum process for managing work.
We are currently using [Ora](https://ora.pm) for tracking tasks and progress, so if you want to join, you should create
an account there.

## How to become a contributor

If you meet the requirements and want to become a contributor, you can send an email to ognian@baruh.net or 
gabrielay2002@gmail.com. In that email you should explain us what part of the project you can help us with (Flask or Svelte)
as well as why you want to join. If you are elected you will receive an email about that, as well as invitations for the
project in Ora and the repository in Github.

## Rules

1. We are following GitHub Flow as a braching strategy. More information about the strategy can be found in the README.md
2. One task in Ora = one pull request in Github. The pull requests must be with the same name as the tasks in Ora.
3. Branches can be merged only by the project owners ([Gabriela Yoncheva](https://github.com/GabrielaY) or 
[Ognian Baruh](https://github.com/ogi02)).
